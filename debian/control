Description: command-line utilities for OpenRPT report import/export
 OpenRPT provides tools for storing and retrieving report definitions
 from a PostgreSQL database. This package contains the headless
 importer (`importrpt`) and exporter (`exportrpt`) utilities which
 allow managing report XML files entirely from the command line.
